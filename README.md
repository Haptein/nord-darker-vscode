## Nord darker

This is just my personal fork of [nord-visual-studio-code](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-visual-studio-code). It definitely is pretty but isn't usable for me since it has very little contrast. I just made the backgound color a bit darker.

If you want to use this just do this:

`
npm install -g vsce
npm run package
`

You will get a file.vsix, install the extension manually in vscode.
